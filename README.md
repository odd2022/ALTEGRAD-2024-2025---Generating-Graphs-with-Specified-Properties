# ALTEGRAD-2024-2025---Generating-Graphs-with-Specified-Properties
Projet for my master's degree with Emilie Pic and Garance GÃ©rard. We ranked 4th out of 58 participants at this challenge.

### Challenge Description: 
Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing new graph generative models, and most of the proposed models typically fall into
one of the following five families of models: (1) Auto-Regressive models; (2) Variational Autoencoders; (3) Generative Adversarial Networks; (4) Normalizing Flows; and (5) Diffusion models. These models can capture the complex
structural and semantic information of graphs. In this challenge, given a text query that
describes some properties of the structure of the graph, you need to generate the graph
corresponding to the description. 

### Code details 
We built our code upon the baseline implementation provided by the instructors, following [Evdaimon et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01535).

Each folder represents a different direction taken in the project. The VAE folder (based on the baseline) was the most conclusive and the direction leading to the est score. 

A file "Rapport_ALTEGRAD.pdf" details more precisely what we did during the challenge.
