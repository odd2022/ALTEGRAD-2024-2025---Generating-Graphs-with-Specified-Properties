# ALTEGRAD-2024-2025---Generating-Graphs-with-Specified-Properties
Projet for my master's degree with Emilie Pic and Garance GÃ©rard. 

Challenge Description: 
The goal of this project is to study and apply machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques
to generate graphs of specific properties. One of the most challenging tasks of machine learning
on graphs is that of graph generation. Graph generation has attracted a lot of attention recently,
and its main objective is to create novel and realistic graphs. For instance, in chemo-informatics,
graph generative models are employed to generate novel, realistic molecular graphs that also
exhibit desired properties (e.g., high drug-likeness). Recently, there has been a surge of interest
in developing new graph generative models, and most of the proposed models typically fall into
one of the following five families of models: (1) Auto-Regressive models; (2) Variational
Autoencoders; (3) Generative Adversarial Networks; (4) Normalizing Flows; and (5) Diffusion
models. These models can capture the complex
structural and semantic information of graphs. In this challenge, given a text query that
describes some properties of the structure of the graph, you need to generate the graph
corresponding to the description. The pipeline to deal with this task can be achieved by training
a latent diffusion for conditional graph generation

We based our code on the baseline given for this project given by the teachers which was [Evdaimon et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01535)
